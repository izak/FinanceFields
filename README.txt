NOTE: This is an import of a very old plone product that is still used in
a few places, patched only as far as to allow using it with plone4.

This product provides fields and widgets for the proper handling of
monetary values inside Plone. It provides a MoneyField with support for
almost all world currencies and a FixedPointField that support decimal
arithmetic with a fixed number of digits.
